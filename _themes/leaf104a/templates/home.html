This is the default template (required), if you choose to not specify a template in your front matter, Statamic uses the following template hierarchy:

If present: post.html
Otherwise, if present: default.html
Otherwise: 404.html

See http://statamic.com/learn/core-concepts/how-pages-are-built for more information.

This template is using the articles template partial with a variable which sets
the limit (number of posts to display). Change the lim="5" variable to however many
posts you would like to display.
