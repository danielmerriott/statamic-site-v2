## What We Do

### Outsourced HR … by the hour

You can use our time and resources for whatever help you need. We are available by phone, video-chat, or email during business hours, and we can even join you at your offices (or elsewhere) to assist in-person.

Whatever HR help you need, we will provide estimates up-front and will keep you informed of progress so you stay in control of your costs.

Typical activities our clients ask us to help with include:

- Supporting recruitment - from designing job descriptions and selection criteria, to searching for candidates, and training managers in interview skills - or outsource it to us completely to free up your time
- Defining team structures and job descriptions
- Designing competency frameworks
- Support with grievances, disciplinary, performance management, or redundancy issues
- Performance and behavioural issues - including bad attitudes, absenteeism and misconduct
- Managing dismissals, redundancies and other turnover matters
- Learning and development and succession plans
- Management skills training
- Reward management
- Onboarding new joiners - manage your hiring risk and give them the best chance of success
- Motivation and high performance
- Solutions to HR crises - attrition problems, absenteeism, harassment etc
- Managing employee records and data
- Generating useful People reports and metrics
- Performance appraisals, day to day performance, and related systems
- HR technology to make life easier!
- HR cover or additional support - we can compliment and support your existing HR team, taking up the slack during peak periods

### Retained HR Partner

If you have regular HR needs, then consider retaining our services via one of our paid Service Plans. In additional to the ‘by the hour’ services this has several benefits including:

- This lets us form a deeper partnership with you, helping us to support you in more meaningful ways and with a more strategic focus.
- You gain access to our services at discounted rates, for both retained hours and any additional HR Services work you may need.
- Develop your own HR skills by working alongside us.


### HR Projects

We are available to assist with any of your HR Projects. Example projects might include:

- HR startup services - putting the basics in place.
- Compliance & Good Practice audit - making sure you have your key HR risks covered
- Implementing (or migrating to) a new HR Information System.
- Recruitment drive.

*Helpful hint: Customers on a paid Service Plan can use any discounted hours the Service Plan for HR project work as well as benefit from the reduced ‘Additional Hours’ rate if more hours are needed.*
