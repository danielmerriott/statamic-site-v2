## Openleaf - HR Business Services

*Putting people on the bottom line*

Openleaf delivers outsourced HR and people management services to small and medium sized businesses throughout New Zealand. We thrive on helping Kiwi businesses manage their people and maximise their potential. We combine world-class HR expertise with New Zealand business savvy to make sure our clients receive practical and effective HR advice without the *‘fluff’* or paper pushing. What we do is real, proven and tested, and it works.

People management is a vital business function - like good accounting, you need strong people practices to achieve top business results and manage legal risks. Openleaf offers relevant, practical and effective services across the full spectrum of HR needs, from basic record keeping to strategic advice. Whether you need help managing a disciplinary matter, hands-on support addressing absenteeism, guidance on training and development, or maybe a simple query such as “how do I implement parental leave?” - we are there to support you. And if you want to put your people at the heart of your business strategy, we can help with that too.

Our services are flexible and accessible, available by the hour, on a discounted retainer basis, or for project or consultancy work.

*Feel free to [get in touch](/contact) if you'd like to know more about how we can help you...*
