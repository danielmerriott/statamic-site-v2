## About Us

Openleaf is a New Zealand owned and operated family business founded in 2013 by Mary-Anne and Daniel Merriott.

Both savvy businesspeople with a passion for helping Kiwi businesses thrive, we saw a need to deliver HR services in the clean, relevant and fluff-free style of a legal or accountancy firm - providing essential business services that are tailored, practical, and represent the best professional quality. Openleaf was formed to bring this vision to life for small and medium sized businesses who require this high quality professional support, without the cost of hiring a full or part time HR Manager of their own.

Openleaf is flexible, affordable and accessible, providing ad hoc advisory work by the hour (with no minimum spend), retained services for those with regular needs (at a discounted rate), as well as project and consultancy work.

## Our Approach

We want to work in a way that is meaningful to us: doing business in a relaxed and friendly way, with integrity, and creating *real value* for our clients. Although we are relaxed and friendly we are **extremely results focussed**.

This means we give *straight answers* and always keep it *as simple as possible*. Honesty and integrity are essential for us - we believe this is part of how we form lasting relationships.
